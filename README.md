# Webpack Typescript Boilerplate
Very simple Webpack 4 Typescript boilerplate html5 starter template kit for webstorm and vscode, with hot reloading, intellij javascript debug configuration.

Just open this project in your IDE and start developing. Write code directly in `src/main.ts` and handle module exports in `src/index.ts`


```
//install dependencies
npm install

//start a dev server to test the project.
npm start

//build a production code and uglifies to generate .min.js in the dist folder. 
npm build
```
